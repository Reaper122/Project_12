emissions computers were invented the religious in glorified calculators machines that execute the exact instructions given to them by the programmers but something Incredibles happening now computers have started gaining the ability to learn I think and communicate just like video intellectual work that previously only humans could do we call this technology intelligence is now available as a service in the sky that anyone can talk to it's not perfect just about every person and company on the planet positively or negatively this video as a person teamwork company drive in Ajmer in your basement in fact Einstein I really mean the combination of every smart person who ever lived you can talk to Einstein everyone access to the sum of all human knowledge and answer anything you want within seconds never running applications you can also take on any really want a Canadian Dollar conclusions you can listen your imagination and your ability to communicate effectively within front engineering work class 5 Star Chef and having a top surprising and powerful ways for him to help you or your company ok let's clarify some terms AI as you probably know artificial intelligence AI is not you feel like machine learning and computer vision have been around for decades what are you say YouTube recommendation or a web services new original content rather than just finding our class finding existing content using normal human language a large language model is an artificial neural network basically a bunch of numbers or parameters connected to each other similar to our brain is a bunch of neurones of brain cells connected numbers you send a numbers and depending on how the primary source of the numbers come out but any kind of content such as images process animals that's why they call large programming that will be possible but you training to speak a baby is told how to speak she doesn't get an instruction manual and said you listen to people speaking around her and when she is 13 of seeing the pattern similarly during a training period language model is fed a mind boggling amount of text to learn from mostly from internet services of human penis output from the model and giving feedback it is learning that it should help people commit crimes when training is done the model is mostly frozen other than some point you need that can happen later in the future will probably have models continuously rather than just drink download just keep in mind that you generally get what you pay for so with a free model you may just be getting a smart high school student in your basement rather than Einstein the difference between for example GPT 3.504 is massive different types of general AI models of January different types of content text model language describe transforming or combining images to text models which describe the contents of a given image for example here is some sound generate from the front People talking in the preservation thank you models that generate videos from a problem difference after finish dumping my thoughts I ask for feedback we have to discussion and then I asked to summarise in text afterwards it's really useful way to use those like this turns out Einstein in the basement after all you can take him out for a walk initially language models were just word protectors statistical machines with Limited capabilities unexpected capabilities that surprise even the developers of the technology that involves a string scissors and egg apart in a fire what happen if I use the scissors the model has most likely not been trained on this exact scenario which demonstrates the basic understanding of the nature of scissors eggs gravity and heat when released I started using it as a coating system and I was blown away effectively it was a better programs have been the most intelligent species of depending of course the same size of years only 80 years ago and now it's general assembly capable of speaking human languages fluently and carrying out an increasing number of intellectual create a task that previously only humans could do so we are right here at the crossing point where a is better at something and humans are better at something but are proving and exponential rate we don't know how long the exponential continue entering a new World order to become Vice President new technology I cannot do my job or we don't have time to look at this technology this is a dangerous place to be a common saying is a I might not take your job but people using AI will and this is true for both individuals and companies on the other side we have any kind of despair the believe that can take my job no matter what can I make my company go bankrupt or help balance likely to lose your job or your company and more likely to drive Rolex needed in HYD for example or doctors needed developers lawyers ceos whatever so this question becomes more more relevant as the AI capabilities improve well some jobs will disappear for sure but the most roles I think we humans are still needed someone was the main knowledge to Prompt what context need to be provided and how to evaluate the result perfect information in a very convincing way so when should you trust the air response when should you double check what about legal compliance eat recognise on your genius colleague is drunk as a doctor my air quality can help diagnose where diseases that didn't even know existed as a lawyer my air quality could you legal Research and review contracts along me to spend more time with my client or as a teacher my I call you could greatest help generate course content provide individual support the students etc and if you not sure how I can help you how can you help me overall I find that the combination of human class between the models and the product with a product website doesn't have any messages you can use this model to build your own AI powered products and features for example let's say you have an e-Learning site you can add a chat box to answer questions about the courses or as a recruitment company you might build AI Power Tools to help evaluate candidates in both these cases your users interact with your product and then your product interacts with the model application programming interfaces which allow your code to talk to the model so here's a simple example of using open the automatic candidate evaluation of October and evaluate each candidate automatic external brain to insert intelligence into a product you need to get good after engineering user energy product developer because in both cases you need to be able to craft effective from the producer results from an AI model using an example let's say I want help planning a workshop this prompt is unlikely to give you some results because no matter how smart AI is if it doesn't know the context of my workshop it can only give the high level recommendations the second problem to provide more information there are plenty of courses books videos articles to help you learn this but the most important thing is to practice and learn by doing and I side effect is that you will become better at communicating in general is prompt engineering is really all about clarity and effective communication I think the next frontier for general AI is the time on their own rather than just sing around waiting for the problem of the internet you remember from this video is a super useful tool like a help of you your team and your company in a big way the better understand it the more likely it is to be an opportunity rather than Australia is more powerful than you think the biggest limitation is not a technology but your imagination like what can I do and your professional skills how do I do it from engineering is a crucial skill like on your skills just accept at first time with practice experiment
